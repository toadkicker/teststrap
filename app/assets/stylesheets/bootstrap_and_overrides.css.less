// Glyphicons - included by default in bootstrap.
// You may need to customize config/initializers/assets.rb (Rails 4), or config/environments/[env].rb to add font paths in.
// In either case of FontAwesome or Glyphicons, the railsstrap:install task should insert the appropriate entries for you.

@import 'fontawesome';

// Your custom LESS stylesheets goes here
//
// Since railsstrap was imported above you have access to its mixins which
// you may use and inherit here, ex:
// @import "bootstrap/less/mixins/alerts.less;
//
// If you'd like to override railsstrap's own variables, you can do so here as well
// See http://bootstrap.github.com/bootstrap/customize.html#variables for their names and documentation
//
// Example:
// @import (reference) 'bootstrap/less/variables.less';
// @link-color: #ff0000;
//
// Date and Time Picker
//
// To enable the date and time picker, uncomment this line:
// @import "datepicker/datepicker.less";
// Don't forget to include the javascript library as well.
